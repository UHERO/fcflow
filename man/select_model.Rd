\title{Run GETS-based model selection using configuration settings.}
\usage{
select_model(
  cfg = load_forecast_cfg(),
  model_select_data = NULL,
  indicators = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cfg}{Configuration list produced by [load_forecast_cfg()].}

\item{model_select_data}{Optional extended dataset from [data_gets()] (wide tibble,
xts, or tsbox-compatible object). When `NULL`, the data are read from disk.}

\item{indicators}{Optional indicator variables (xts). When `NULL`, the file
specified in the configuration is loaded.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list containing fitted models, data, and plots.
}
\description{
Executes the GETS workflow for a single equation, sourcing all parameters
from `config.yml`. The function can optionally accept preloaded data to avoid
disk reads and returns key artefacts invisibly for downstream use.
set yvar_name, xvar_list and other parameters
dataset contains extended history and pseudo-forecast
model equation saved in text file ready to be copied
plot compares new forecast with pseudo-forecast
